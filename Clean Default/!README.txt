About this skin :
=======================

Template by Corne2Plum3 (https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15646039).

This is the just the default skin from the stable version (no target practice sprites sorry...), but 2021 version (from the 20210821 version to be exact). I tried to make  the default skin but updated (the last I found was from 2014...), and complete (I added almost missing files) where skinners use it as a template to create their skin.

Most of the sprites and gameplay sounds are from ppy/osu-ressources (https://github.com/ppy/osu-resources). Sometimes I used an AI to generates the @2x versions of some files. For the sounds, I tried to pick them directly from the game, so sorry if it's not accurate...

Please don't kill me for making this, peppy!


A few notes :
=============

BACK BUTTON:
It's impossible to recreate the back button. In this skin, there is just 1 frame of the back button. Unlike the default, he's isn't animated, and doesn't change according to the game language.

COMBO SPRITES:
Same than score sprites.

SLIDERBALL: 
It's IMPOSSIBLE to recreate exactly the default sliderball with skinning, because sliderb files disable sliderb-spec (overlay) and sliderb-nd (background). So you will see only sliderb files in game with this skin.
The only way to have the same sliderball than the default skin is deleting ALL slider ball files (sliderb, sliderb-spec and sliderb-nd).

SPINNER APPROACH CIRCLE:
With the default skin which uses new spinner, spinner-approachcircle is invisible. In the folder 'new spinner/visible approach circle' you have the default spinner-approachcircle if this file is needed.
